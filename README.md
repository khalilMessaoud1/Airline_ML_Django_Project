# ✈️ Airline Loyalty Analytics Platform  
### Data Science • Machine Learning • Business Intelligence • Django

This project is a data-driven platform designed to analyze airline loyalty program data in order to better understand customer behavior, segment travelers, and predict seasonal travel patterns.  
It combines **data engineering**, **machine learning**, **business intelligence**, and a **Django web application** into a single end-to-end solution.
